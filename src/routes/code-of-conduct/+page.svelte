			throughout the conference and at all conference events. To make clear what is expected, all
			staff, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organisers, and volunteers at Frontend Festival are

		<h2>BE PROFESSIONAL AND DON'T SPAM</h2>
		<p>
			We consider Frontend Festival a great setting to showcase the work of the community and would
			like to encourage networking and business related discussions, as well as keep the conference
			presentations meaningful and interesting for everyone. We therefore:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				primarily make company marketing, promotional or recruiting related activities at the
				conference available to our paid sponsors, unless agreed otherwise;
			</li>
			<li>
				request presentations - outside the official recruiting sessions - to focus on Frontend
				Festival related topics, not on recruitment.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The Frontend Festival organisation will be happy to answer any questions related to marketing
			or recruiting activities.
		</p>

		<h2>CONSEQUENCES</h2>
		<p>
			If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, the Frontend
			Festival organization team may take action they deem appropriate, including warning the
			offender or expulsion from the community and community events with no refund of event tickets.
			Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for everyone.
		</p>
